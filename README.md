### Domain Generating Algorithm based Malicious Domains Detection
Botnets often use Domain Generating Algorithms (DGAs) to facilitate covert server communication in carrying out different types of cyber-attacks. Attackers employ these algorithms to generate millions of sites for victim machines to connect to, thus evading defense using blacklists. DGAs enables attacks to be facilitated without the fear of command and control (C\&C) servers being identified and permanently blocked.

In this study, we develop a suite of effective detection mechanisms for both traditional and dictionary-based DGAs. We analyze 84 different malware familiesâ€™ dataset with the Virus-Total API service to verify the status of each of the malicious domains using multiple Antivirus scan engines. We utilize DNS queries to determine whether a domain is a non-existent domain (NXDomain) and hence, short-lived. We extract useful features to further analyze the domain strings. The Bigram model was used with several Machine Learning techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and the Word2Vec model was used with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
